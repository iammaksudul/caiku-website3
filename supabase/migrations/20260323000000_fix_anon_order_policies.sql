  # Fix anonymous user order policies

  1. Allow anonymous users to:
     - INSERT order_items (needed for customer checkout)
     - SELECT orders (needed for order lookup by email/phone)
     - SELECT order_items (needed for order lookup)
     - UPDATE orders (needed for customer to update notes)
     - UPDATE/DELETE order_items (needed for customer to modify pending order items)

  2. Add stock decrement trigger
     - Automatically decrements wallpaper stock when order_item is inserted
     - Uses SECURITY DEFINER so it runs with elevated privileges
